The first step is to decide what to work on. The work you choose needs to have
three qualities: it has to be something you have a natural aptitude for, that
you have a deep interest in, and that offers scope to do great work.

In practice you don't have to worry much about the third criterion. Ambitious
people are if anything already too conservative about it. So all you need to do
is find something you have an aptitude for and great interest in. [1]

That sounds straightforward, but it's often quite difficult. When you're young
you don't know what you're good at or what different kinds of work are like.
Some kinds of work you end up doing may not even exist yet. So while some
people know what they want to do at 14, most have to figure it out.

The way to figure out what to work on is by working. If you're not sure what to
work on, guess. But pick something and get going. You'll probably guess wrong
some of the time, but that's fine. It's good to know about multiple things;
some of the biggest discoveries come from noticing connections between
different fields.

Develop a habit of working on your own projects. Don't let "work" mean
something other people tell you to do. If you do manage to do great work one
day, it will probably be on a project of your own. It may be within some bigger
project, but you'll be driving your part of it
