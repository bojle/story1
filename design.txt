# What is it

- Textual Storytelling
- interactive
- key based inputs
- a series of slides that make a chapter
- each chapter has with it a tone (can be implicit (no sound) or explicit
  (attached with a sound)
- on 'next', play next chapter with its tone


# Architecture

These are the elements: chapter, tone, story, input event

## chapter

- ncurses (to clear screen and put the cursor at the top)
- 80 character output
- each chapter has a correspondign base64 enc strign, decode it, and print
- play the tone for current chapter

## tone

- the story has a tone map
- tone_map[total_chapters]
- tone_map[0] = {base64 enc of contained audio}


## story 

for (int i = 0; i < total_chapters; ++i) {
	play_chapter(i, chapter_list, tone_map);
}

## input event

- the music player needs to be non-blocking (asyncrhonous), for if it isn't how
  would input events be registered when we're waiting for the music to finish
- the interface: h -> back, l -> forward


## music

- klettur - sigur ros
-
